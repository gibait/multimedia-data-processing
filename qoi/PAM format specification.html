<h1>PAM format specification</h1>
Updated: 27 November 2013

<h2 id="general">GENERAL</h2>

<p>The PAM image format is a lowest common denominator 2 dimensional map
    format.

<p>It is designed to be used for any of myriad kinds of graphics, but can
    theoretically be used for any kind of data that is arranged as a two
    dimensional rectangular array. Actually, from another perspective it
    can be seen as a format for data arranged as a three dimensional
    array.

<p>The name "PAM" is an acronym derived from "Portable
    Arbitrary Map." This derivation makes more sense if you consider
    it in the context of the other Netpbm format names: PBM, PGM, and PPM.

<p>This format does not define the meaning of the data at any particular
    point in the array. It could be red, green, and blue light
    intensities such that the array represents a visual image, or it could
    be the same red, green, and blue components plus a transparency
    component, or it could contain annual rainfalls for places on the
    surface of the Earth. Any process that uses the PAM format must
    further define the format to specify the meanings of the data.

<p>A PAM image describes a two dimensional grid of tuples. The tuples are
    arranged in rows and columns. The width of the image is the number of
    columns. The height of the image is the number of rows. All rows are the
    same width and all columns are the same height. The tuples may have any
    degree, but all tuples have the same degree. The degree of the tuples is
    called the depth of the image. Each member of a tuple is called a sample. A
    sample is an unsigned integer which represents a locus along a scale which
    starts at zero and ends at a certain maximum value called the maxval. The
    maxval is the same for every sample in the image. The two dimensional array
    of all the Nth samples of each tuple is called the Nth plane or Nth channel of
    the image.

<p>Though the basic format does not assign any meaning to the tuple values, it
    does include an optional string that describes that meaning. The
    contents of this string, called the tuple type, are arbitrary from the
    point of view of the basic PAM format, but users of the format may assign
    meaning to it by convention so they can identify their particular
    implementations of the PAM format. Some tuple types are defined as
    official subformats of PAM. See <a href="#tupletype">Defined Tuple Types</a>.

<h2 id="format_universe">The Confusing Universe of Netpbm Formats</h2>

<p>It is easy to get confused about the relationship between the PAM
    format and PBM, PGM, PPM, and PNM. Here is a little enlightenment:

<p>"PNM" is not really a format. It is a shorthand for the PBM, PGM,
    and PPM formats collectively. It is also the name of a group of
    library functions that can each handle all three of those formats.

<p>"PAM" is in fact a fourth format. But it is so general
    that you can represent the same information in a PAM image as you can
    in a PBM, PGM, or PPM image. And in fact a program that is designed
    to read PBM, PGM, or PPM and does so with a recent version of the
    Netpbm library will read an equivalent PAM image just fine and the
    program will never know the difference.

<p>To confuse things more, there is a collection of library routines
    called the "pam" functions that read and write the PAM
    format, but also read and write the PBM, PGM, and PPM formats. They
    do this because the latter formats are much older and more popular, so
    even a new program must work with them. Having the library handle all
    the formats makes it convenient to write programs that use the newer
    PAM format as well.

<h2 id="layout">THE LAYOUT</h2>

<p>A convenient way to read and write the PAM format accurately is via the
    <a href="libnetpbm.html">libnetpbm</a> C subroutine library.

<p>A PAM file consists of a sequence of one or more PAM images. There are
    no data, delimiters, or padding before, after, or between images.

<p>
    Each PAM image consists of a header followed immediately by a raster.
<p>
    Here is an example header:

<pre>
<span style="font-family: monospace">
P7
WIDTH 227
HEIGHT 149
DEPTH 3
MAXVAL 255
TUPLTYPE RGB
ENDHDR
</span>
</pre>

<p>The header begins with the ASCII characters "P7" followed
    by newline. This is the magic number.

<p>Note: <b>xv</b> thumbnail images also start with the "P7" magic number.
    (This and PAM were independent extensions to the Netpbm formats). The rest
    of the format makes it easy to distinguish PAM from that format, though).

<p>The header continues with an arbitrary number of lines of ASCII
    text. Each line ends with and is delimited by a newline character.

<p>Each header line consists of zero or more whitespace-delimited
    tokens or begins with "#". If it begins with "#"
    it is a comment and the rest of this specification does not apply to
    it.

<p>A header line which has zero tokens is valid but has no meaning.

<p>The type of header line is identified by its first token, which is
    8 characters or less:

<dl compact>
    <dt><b>ENDHDR </b>

    <dd>This is the lastPixel line in the header. The header must contain
        exactly one of these header lines.

    <dt><b>HEIGHT </b>

    <dd>The second token is a decimal number representing the height
        of the image (number of rows). The header must contain exactly one
        of these header lines.

    <dt><b>WIDTH</b>

    <dd>The second token is a decimal number representing the width of the
        image (number of columns). The header must contain exactly one of
        these header lines.

    <dt><b>DEPTH</b>

    <dd>The second token is a decimal number representing the depth of the
        image (number of planes or channels). The header must contain exactly
        one of these header lines.

    <dt><b>MAXVAL</b>

    <dd>The second token is a decimal number representing the maxval of the image.
        The header must contain exactly one of these header lines.

    <dt><b>TUPLTYPE</b>

    <dd>The header may contain any number of these header lines, including
        zero. The rest of the line is part of the tuple type. The rest of
        the line is not tokenized, but the tuple type does not include any
        white space immediately following <b>TUPLTYPE </b> or at the very end
        of the line. It does not include a newline. There must be something
        other than white space after the <b>TUPLTYPE</b> token.

        <p>If there are multiple <b>TUPLTYPE</b> header lines, the tuple type
            is the concatenation of the values from each of them, separated by a
            single blank, in the order in which they appear in the header. If
            there are no <b>TUPLTYPE</b> header lines the tuple type is the null
            string.

</dl>

<p>
    The raster consists of each row of the image, in order from top to bottom,
    consecutive with no delimiter of any kind between, before, or after, rows.
<p>
    Each row consists of every tuple in the row, in order from left to
    right, consecutive with no delimiter of any kind between, before, or
    after, tuples.
<p>
    Each tuple consists of every sample in the tuple, in order,
    consecutive with no delimiter of any kind between, before, or after,
    samples.
<p>
    Each sample consists of an unsigned integer in pure binary format,
    with the most significant byte first. The number of bytes is the
    minimum number of bytes required to represent the maxval of the image.

<p>The character referred to as "newline" herein is the
    character known in ASCII as Line Feed or LF.

<h2 id="limitations">LIMITATIONS</h2>

<p>Height, width, depth, and maxval are at least 1.

<p>Height, width, and depth have no defined maximum, but processors and
    generators of images usually have their own limitations.

<p>The maxval of an image is never greater than 65535. (The reason it is
    limited is to make it easier to build an image processor, in which
    intermediate arithmetic values often have to fit within 31 or 32 bits).
    There was no specified limitation before October, 2005, but essentially
    all implementations have always observed it.

<h2 id="tupletype">DEFINED TUPLE TYPES</h2>

<p>Some tuple types are defined in this specification to specify
    official subformats of PAM for especially popular applications of the
    format. Users of the format may also define their own tuple types,
    and thus their own subformats.

<p>Tuple type affects <em>only</em> the meanings of the samples (which are
    unsigned integers) in the tuples of the image. It does not affect how the
    samples or tuples are encoded. Tuple type may affect the meaning of a tuple's
    position in the array (e.g. it may indicate in a visual image that a tuple
    in Row 1 is one at the top of the image rather than the bottom).

<p>Tuple type never determines how many samples are in a tuple (that is
    instead determined by the DEPTH header line). Tuple type could be said to
    imply a depth (number of samples per tuple) because certain tuple types are
    valid only in combination with certain DEPTH values, but it is good
    programming practice to use DEPTH for the depth when decoding the raster and
    separately validate that the depth is consistent with the tuple type. Also,
    it is good practice to accept a depth that is too great and just ignore the
    higher numbered planes.

<h3 id="visual">PAM Used For Visual Images</h3>

<p>A common use of PAM images is to represent visual images such
    as are typically represented by images in the older and more concrete
    PBM, PGM, and PPM formats.

<h4>Black And White</h4>

<p>A black and white image, such as would alternatively be represented by a
    PBM image, has a tuple type of "BLACKANDWHITE". Such a PAM image has a depth
    of 1 and maxval 1 where the one sample in each tuple is 0 to represent a black
    pixel and 1 to represent a white one. The maxval, height, width, and order of
    tuples in the raster bear the obvious relationship to those of the equivalent
    PGM image.

<p>Note that in the PBM format, a sample value of zero means white, but in
    PAM, zero means black.

<h4>Grayscale</h4>

<p>A grayscale image, such as would alternatively be represented by a PGM
    image, has a tuple type of "GRAYSCALE". Such a PAM image has a depth of 1.
    The maxval, height, width, and raster bear the obvious relationship to those
    of the equivalent PGM image.

<h4>Color</h4>

<p>A color image, such as would alternatively be represented by a PPM image,
    has a tuple type of "RGB". Such a PAM image has a depth of 3. The maxval,
    height, width, and raster bear the obvious relationship to those of the PPM
    image. The first plane represents red, the second green, and the third blue.

<h4>Transparent</h4>

<p>Each of the visual image formats mentioned above has a variation that
    contains transparency information. In that variation, the tuple type
    has "_ALPHA" added to it (e.g. "RGB_ALPHA") and one
    more plane. The highest numbered plane is the opacity plane (sometimes
    called an alpha plane or transparency plane).

<p>In this kind of image, the color represented by a pixel is actually
    a combination of an explicitly specified foreground color and a background
    color to be identified later.

<p>The planes other than the opacity plane describe the foreground
    color. A sample in the opacity plane tells how opaque the pixel is, by
    telling what fraction of the pixel's light comes from the foreground
    color. The rest of the pixel's light comes from the (unspecified)
    background color.

<p>For example, in a GRAYSCALE_ALPHA image, assume Plane 0 indicates
    a gray tone 60% of white and Plane 1 indicates opacity 25%. The
    foreground color is the 60% gray, and 25% of that contributes to the
    ultimate color of the pixel. The other 75% comes from some background
    color. So let's assume further that the background color of the pixel
    is full white. Then the color of the pixel is 90% of white: 25% of
    the foreground 60%, plus 75% of the background 100%.

<p>The sample value is the opacity fraction just described, as a fraction
    of the maxval. Note that it is <em>not</em> gamma-adjusted like the
    foreground color samples.


<h2 id="internetmediatype">INTERNET MEDIA TYPE</h2>

<p>No Internet Media Type (aka MIME type, content type) for PAM has been
    registered with IANA, but the unofficial value
    <span style="font-family: monospace">image/x-portable-arbitrarymap</span> is
    assigned by this specification, to be consistent with conventional values for
    the older Netpbm formats.

<h2 id="filename">FILE NAME</h2>

<p>The conventional suffix for the name of a PAM file is ".pam".
    But this is not required.
